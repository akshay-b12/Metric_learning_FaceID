ITML: Information Theoretic Metric Learning:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/pjain/itml/
ITML is a Matlab implementation of Information Theoretic Metric Learning algorithm. Metric learning involves finding a suitable metric for a given set of data-points with side-information regarding distances between few datapoints. ITML characterizes the metric using a Mahalanobis distance function and learns the associated parameters using Bregman's cyclic projection algorithm.

https://pypi.org/project/PyLMNN/
PyLMNN is an implementation of the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor algorithm for metric learning in pure python.

PyLMNN :
This implementation follows closely the original MATLAB code by Kilian Weinberger found at https://bitbucket.org/mlcircus/lmnn. This version solves the unconstrained optimisation problem and finds a linear transformation using L-BFGS as the backend optimizer.This package can also find optimal hyper-parameters for LMNN via Bayesian Optimization using the excellent GPyOpt package.
